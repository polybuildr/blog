    <p>I had noticed it throughout the evening. Little glimpses of it, here and there. It was the 31<sup>st</sup> of December, 2014.</p>
<p>The end of a year. The beginning of a new one. A rather significant day, albeit rather arbitrary. But while a large part of the population was out enjoying their day, one set of people wasn't. It was their job to not.</p>

    <p>How time passes.</p>
<p>I opened my front door and let myself into my house. I looked at my mom. "I've grown up," I declared, slightly shocked.</p>
<p>She looked back at me, nonplussed.</p>

    <p>"Last call for passengers travelling to Newark by United Airlines Flight 49, please report to gate 2 immediately for departure. Last call for..."</p>
<p>I woke up with a start. I hurried to the gate, shoving the copy of 'The Book Thief' that I'd bought at the airport into my backpack. This was the first time I wasn't already in the plane by the time the last call sounded. My parents would be mortified if they found out.</p>

    <p>I first started blogging around four years ago, some time in the middle of 2010. My first blog was called 'A Thought or Three', which I then thought was a pretty cool name. However, SEO caused me to move to <a href="http://mywirelessmind.blogspot.com">My Wireless Mind</a>. I blogged there for a couple of years, until the December of '12.</p>
