    <p>After looking at how <a href="http://yeoman.io">yeoman.io</a> generates their website using <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a>, I thought I'd give it a try myself. After spending a couple of hours figuring out how all of this stuff works (and making a lot of mistakes<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-travis-mistakes"><a href="#fn-travis-mistakes" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in the process), I am pleased to say that this blog is now built by Travis! :D</p>

    <p>I've been writing CSS for over 3 years now. I used a lot of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> when it was still at v2.3.2. I've also taken a look at other CSS frameworks, such as <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> and <a href="http://purecss.io/">Pure</a> and also looked at smaller projects, such as <a href="http://daneden.github.io/Toast/">Toast</a>, a CSS grid implementation. However, most of my projects involved significant customization - some projects didn't use a framework at all - so I ended up picking up a lot of CSS.</p>
<p>I've always thought that frameworks as complete as Bootstrap (sometimes referred to as <em>bloated</em>) were awesome. Need a navbar? Of course it's included. Need a sliding image carousel? Yep, we've got that too.</p>
<p>But I've always wondered. What if, instead of including everything that a project might need, you simply included some basics? How much code would you have to write? How would it compare to Bootstrap's <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">whopping 122.5 kB</a>?</p>

    <p>A new version of <a href="https://github.com/polybuildr/petroglyph">Petroglyph</a> is out, <a href="https://github.com/polybuildr/petroglyph/releases/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a>! This blog has been updated too, and is now being generated by v0.2.0.</p>
<p>I started work on Petroglyph <a href="http://polybuildr.github.io/blog/bit-nebula-and-petroglyph">a year ago</a>. The code I wrote then did a lot of stupid things and had a lot of things missing, but well, it worked. When I completed that version, I remember deciding that I would certainly come back one day and update it.</p>

    <p>I had noticed it throughout the evening. Little glimpses of it, here and there. It was the 31<sup>st</sup> of December, 2014.</p>
<p>The end of a year. The beginning of a new one. A rather significant day, albeit rather arbitrary. But while a large part of the population was out enjoying their day, one set of people wasn't. It was their job to not.</p>

    <p>How time passes.</p>
<p>I opened my front door and let myself into my house. I looked at my mom. "I've grown up," I declared, slightly shocked.</p>
<p>She looked back at me, nonplussed.</p>

    <p>"Last call for passengers travelling to Newark by United Airlines Flight 49, please report to gate 2 immediately for departure. Last call for..."</p>
<p>I woke up with a start. I hurried to the gate, shoving the copy of 'The Book Thief' that I'd bought at the airport into my backpack. This was the first time I wasn't already in the plane by the time the last call sounded. My parents would be mortified if they found out.</p>

    <p>I first started blogging around four years ago, some time in the middle of 2010. My first blog was called 'A Thought or Three', which I then thought was a pretty cool name. However, SEO caused me to move to <a href="http://mywirelessmind.blogspot.com">My Wireless Mind</a>. I blogged there for a couple of years, until the December of '12.</p>
