            <p>It was Terry Pratchet who - for lack of a better word - <em>formally</em> introduced me to what he calls 'Third Thoughts' in his book, <em>A Hat Full of Sky</em>.</p>

<p>In the book, which is a story about a young girl who's learning to be a witch, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"First Thoughts are the everyday thoughts. Everyone has those. Second Thoughts are the thoughts you think about the way you think. People who enjoy thinking have those. Third Thoughts are thoughts that watch the world and think all by themselves. They're rare, and often troublesome. Listening to them is part of witchcraft."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><!--more-->I loved this idea. That there are higher <em>levels</em> of thought. Meta-thoughts, if you will. While the younger me was wondering about this, contemplating the effect that such a way of looking at things might have, he realised something.</p>

<p>The fact that he could realise that he was having a second thought, meant that he was having a thought about having a second thought, which automatically implied that he was having a third thought. And if he realised he was having a third thought, then, well, that was a fourth thought. Forgive me for putting it this way, but it was pretty much an application of mathematical induction. If you realise you're having an n<sup>th</sup> thought, then you're having an n+1<sup>th</sup> thought.</p>

<p>The younger me closed the book and put it down. He sat there gazing into nowhere, wondering at the significance of this <em>discovery</em> of his.</p>

<p>The human mind is complex. I love analysing things as systems (quite informally). But every time I try to analyse the human mind as a system, all that happens is that my mind gets boggled. You can check your own thinking, and then check the thinking that's doing the checking of the thinking. At what level do you stop? At what level does the brain stop? Are there some crazy people out there who went crazy because they realised they could have infinite levels and got stuck?</p>

<p>Everybody uses techniques of self-control and self-persuasion. From getting up in the morning even though you want to sleep, to convincing yourself that there is no reason to be nervous about an exam or a competition, we all do it. But it starts to get <strong>really</strong> mind boggling when you realise that the part that wants to sleep is you, the part that's trying to wake you up is you, the part that's nervous about the competition is you and the part that's trying to convince you to be confident is also you. It's all in the head!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Looking back at that paragraph above, I should probably calm down before someone accuses me of being cuckoo. All I'm saying is that if you think about it hard enough, you cannot help but let your mind get blown. A brain that thinks something and needs an external force to change what it thinks is relatively very simple to understand. A brain that can re-evaluate what it just thought, argue with itself about the merits of each case, possibly come up with some more cases, finally pick a course of action one way or another and then, later, wonder whether it picked the right course of action? Now that is a system that simply blows my mind.</p>

<p>This rather abstract topic could be discussed ad infinitum, so I'll just conclude by saying that it is rather ironic that human brains have not been able to understand the human brain, isn't it?</p>
